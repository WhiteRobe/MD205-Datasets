### **DESCRIPTION**

> ⚠ Note this data can only be used for non-commercial applications.

This dataset(MD205) works like [SIM10K](https://fcav.engin.umich.edu/projects/driving-in-the-matrix):

> Deep learning has rapidly transformed the state of the art algorithms used to address a variety of problems in computer vision and robotics. These breakthroughs have however relied upon massive amounts of human annotated training data. By training machine learning algorithms on a rich virtual world, we can illustrate that real objects in real scenes can be learned and classified using synthetic data. This approach offers the possibility of accelerating deep learning’s application to sensor based classification problems like those that appear in self-driving cars.

This dataset contains some artificial images of American streets in the 1960s. Specially, we capture images form video game *Mafia: Definitive Edition* and annotated by stuff, for domain adaptation research or few-shot domain adaptation object detection problem (eg. SIM10K → MD205).

### DATASET

This few-shot dataset contains:

- 205 images and annotations.

- 3 classes: car, person, motorcycle.
- 7 unlabeled images.
